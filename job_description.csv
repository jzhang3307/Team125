ba8ddc918fb8ee443c59b8351f65015a,Senior Software Engineer,"Company Description Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. Job Description Etsy's Data Engineering department builds systems and infrastructure and writes data pipelines for collecting, storing, and analyzing huge sets of data in batch and streaming contexts. As a member of the Data Pipeliners team, you'll help us identify, extract, and write shared data pipelines that power hundreds to thousands of downstream data processing jobs; you'll be responsible for designing new methods and tooling for ensuring the validity and quality of our data; and you will help other teams write robust data pipelines in Scala Spark, BigQuery SQL, and Kafka Streams. We value curiosity, enthusiasm, responsibility and generosity of spirit. We're looking for a flexible engineer who cares about the data that flows through pipelines and the internal customers who will use that data. We care more about being excited to pivot to the appropriate tool for the job than having deep expertise in single systems. We work in Scala, Python, Java, and SQL, and we work with technologies like Spark, Kafka, Scalding, Airflow, Looker, Dataproc, and BigQuery. Experience with any of these is helpful but not required. The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, and that the work we do is part of a larger creative culture that includes the hundreds of thousands of inspired artists and designers who make Etsy such a unique marketplace. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We believe in measuring everything, taking advantage of our continuous deployment system to ship code early and often, and keeping up a blameless culture based on trust and a commitment to learning. This is a full time role. Our team is headquartered in Brooklyn, but we support remote work and accept remote applicants. For candidates who will work remotely from Colorado, visit this link for information related to Colorado's Equal Pay for Equal Work Act. Full-time employees are also eligible for Etsy's bonus program, equity program, and amazing benefits package. See our Careers Page for more details. Qualifications ABOUT THE ROLE Our team is responsible for the daily delivery of hundreds of business-critical datasets. We help define, maintain, and monitor the ETL pipelines and data models that power our core business analytics datasets and the upstream feature data that feeds all of Etsy's machine learning systems. We build and maintain internal tools for monitoring and validating high-quality data. Our team is leading the company's migration from Scalding to Spark by developing data onboarding materials, defining best practices, and adding tooling to ensure that pipelines are well-written. ABOUT YOU You understand that being an effective software engineer is about communicating with people as much as it is about writing code. You are willing to work with and improve code you did not originally write. You are generous with your time and experience, and can mentor and learn from other engineers. You can tackle unconstrained problems and know when to seek help. You are flexible with languages and tools and are willing to learn whatever is necessary to get the job done. You have familiarity with a few of the following: writing and scheduling ETL pipelines, writing SQL queries for exploration and analysis, tuning mapreduce jobs and cluster resources, building and monitoring cloud services, stream processing systems like Kafka Streams, Spark, or Dataflow. Additional Information What's Next If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you’ve hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don’t want you to be like everyone else — we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you’re all about. Our Promise At Etsy, we believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a more relevant, more competitive, and more resilient company. We encourage people from all backgrounds, ages, abilities, and experiences to apply. Etsy is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, pregnancy or caregiver status, veteran status, or any other legally protected status.

4fa16bbc76a142b230bc568630c16b3c,Software Engineer,"Full Job Description Job Title: Software Engineer Company: ViSOAR LLC Location: Salt Lake City, UT (fully remote option available) Reports to: Chief Operations Officer Contact to apply with a letter of intent and a CV. A list of contacts for references will be required if interviewed. Company Vision: ViSOAR LLC is devoted to furthering modern data-driven science and technological innovation by making massive scientific data easy to use without requiring expensive hardware. By providing user-friendly tools that manage imaging data of all scales, ViSOAR aims at empowering scientists and engineers in academia and industry to benefit society at large with innovations that traditionally have been confined to few elite investigators. Company Summary: Founded in 2011, ViSOAR LLC (formerly known as ViSUS LLC) is a start-up company with four full-time employees, several consultants and interns for temporary activities. The company was created as a spin-off of the University of Utah to develop and commercialize research software originally created for training geologists in the field with massive imagery for oil and gas companies. Since its inception, ViSOAR has identified a much broader and approachable market that is an ideal fit for our image reading and writing pipeline for massive data including industries such as healthcare, neuroscience, ecology, agriculture, and materials science. ViSOAR LLC provides a software framework designed with the primary philosophy that the visualization of massive data need not be tied to specialized hardware or infrastructures. In other words, a visualization environment for large data can be designed to be lightweight, highly scalable, and run on a variety of platforms. Due to the large size of datasets, the data samples cannot all be loaded into main memory and ViSOAR streaming solutions are not limited by local hardware resources. Additionally, ViSOAR software can access and visualize data while it is being produced, enabling real-time monitoring of remote experiments, something that is difficult with existing file formats. The analysis and visualization of large-scale data is a major challenge of modern science. As new data acquisition devices are built to generate more accurate, high-resolution information, data users struggle with the difficulty of gaining access and making practical use of the information generated. The large data analysis and visualization tools being developed by ViSOAR are becoming a critical component in many areas of data manipulation and analysis. ViSOAR management and processing of big data allows the translation of the raw data into discovery faster and leads to actionable information faster, such as finding out early that someone opened the door and flooded the room with light thereby ruining the scan during the first hour of a four-hour electron microscopy scan. Over the next 5 years, ViSOAR will see the completion of our pipeline and its adoption in software that comes installed on HPC machines as well as products with storage as a service. ViSOAR is well-positioned to be the de facto standard for reading and writing of massive data for HPC simulation, analytics and visualization, and the development of VisStore™ and our ViSOAR Data Portal positions us to become the de facto standard for storage as well. The Position: We are looking for a candidate with a strong software engineering background to develop and maintain software tools and to participate in the full SDLC (software development lifecycle), from concept and design to testing. Candidate should have CS fundamentals, problem-solving skills, coding and debugging skills, in particular with multi-threaded code; should be a strong, capable C/C++ and Python; should have solid experience driving algorithmic solutions from prototype to implementation; should have an understanding of or experience with modern devops tooling. The candidate should be able to learn and adapt quickly and should have excellent written and verbal communication skills and be a pro-active problem solver. These include: Competitive salaries 37.5-hour work week Flexible hours/schedule In office, fully remote, or hybrid work options 13 paid holidays Generous paid time off policy Additional paid office closure days (typically the office closes the week between Christmas and New Year’s) Casual dress code Mission over profit prioritization This role is a mix of 80% programming and 20% other responsibilities. In addition to technical skills, applicants must have clear communication skills, a solid work ethic, and be able to thrive in a team environment. Must be a self-starter, capable of working with minimal direction. ViSOAR LLC currently utilizes a hybrid office/work-from-home model for all staff, but a fully remote option is available for highly qualified candidates.
