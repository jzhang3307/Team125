# Team125
Final Project code for Team 125

To run the files, first create a virtual environment. We used a conda environment, which can be created by:


conda create --name dva_env python=3.7 -y

The conda environment can be activated by:

conda activate dva_env

The requirements for this project are in the requirements folder and can be isntalled by:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once all the requirements can be installed, the python files can be ran individually. Please note that the csv files must be in the root folder to run, or 
edit the path variable in the code.
